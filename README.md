# Complex-Math
My project is a program written in C++ that deals with complex numbers. The program allows the user to perform various mathematical operations on complex numbers, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. The program should provide a user-friendly interface for the user to input the complex numbers and choose the desired operation. The program should also display the result of the operation in a clear and understandable format. Additionally, the program should handle errors and exceptions that may occur during the calculation process. Overall, the goal of the project is to provide a tool that simplifies complex number calculations and makes them more accessible to users.
